<h1>Travel Wallet: Privacy policy</h1>
<br>
Welcome to the Travel Wallet app!
<br><br>
This is an open-source Android app developed by Yutaro Sakairi. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by you (the user) is stored on your device only and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.<br><br>
Here are the permissions required. <br>
| Permission | Why is it required |
| --- | --- |
| `android:permission.INTERNET` | This is required to get the currency conversion rate so that you get the up-to-date conversions. |
| `com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID` | This is required to show ads. It uniquely identifies a particular user for advertising use cases, such as ad personalization. |
|` com.android.vending.BILLING` | This is required to enable in-app purchases. |

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me or have any questions regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

<br><br>
Best, <br>
